### Upgrading from older versions to 0.8.0:

When upgrading from an older version to **0.8.0**, in order to avoid many
conflicts do the following changes before merging, if you had changes in the
styles, scripts and added more static libraries:

- `static/lib` > `static/src/lib`
- `static/src/coffee` > `static/src/script`
- `static/src/less` > `static/src/style`
- Update the paths in the `config.py`
- That setup will not work after these changes, but for the rest of the
  changes it should be easy to merge.
